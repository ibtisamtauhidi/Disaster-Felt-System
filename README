Disaster Felt System
************************************************
************************************************
HTML 5 (GeoLocation, localStorage, CacheManifest), JavaScript, AJAX, Php, MySQL


External Library : geo.js (to make it compitable with non-HTML5 devices like Nokia, Blackberry, PalmOS and desktop browsers running Google Gears.)


This app lets a victim of natural disaster upload their location and other data using a GPS & HTML5 enabled device (eg. Android, iPhone) to a server.

This data can be retrieved by a rescue worker to locate the user using Vincenty's Inverse Formula (to find distance with 0.05mm accuracy) and static Google Maps API (to locate victim on map).

The client and server are seperated and hence it can also be packed as widgets (web-apps that can be installed and which behave like native app). I already packed it for S60 5th Edition.
